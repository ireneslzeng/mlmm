# Introduction

## Summary  
High throughput mass-spectrometry clinical proteomics studies curate
abundance data with hierarchical structure. The non-random missingness
of the measurements from a vast amount of information also adds
complexity in data analysis. We propose a multivariate 2 level model
to analyze protein abundances and to handle abundance-dependent
Missingness within a Bayesian framework.  The proposed model enables
the variance decomposition at different levels of the data hierarchy
and provides central shrinkage of protein-level estimates for proteins
with small numbers of observations.  A logistic regression model with
informative prior of the regression coefficient is used to model the
missing probability.  The non-random missing and censored values are
treated as unknown parameters in a Bayesian model. Hamiltonian
MC/No-U-Turn Sampling algorithm is created to derive the posterior
distribution of the unknown parameters.  Hamiltonian MC is
demonstrated to gain more efficiency for these high-dimensional
correlated data.



## The proposed model 
We use an inference model within a multivariate-multilevel framework
to analyze the protein abundance data that are curated in clinical
proteomics studies. These models decompose variations from different
sources, such as experimental factors, proteins' biological features
and biological samples' physiological properties. It is also known
that in the ion intensities data which is used to construct protein's
relative abundance, its missing values depend on the unobserved
abundance values and the probability of missing associated with some
observable experiment factors.  In addition to this, due to the detection
limit of a device, we also observe left-censoring
values in the output from many studies.  We model
non-random missingness as either left-censored or completely missing
using one of the proposed likelihood-based method of Little and Rubin.  
Little (1993), Little and Rubin (1987) proposed three likelihood-based methods
(selection model, pattern-mixture model and shared-parameter model) for 
Missing Not At Random (MNAR). Selection model, in which the missing data
mechanism and parameters of the inferential model are conditionally
estimated given the hypothetical completed data, is an appropriate
approach given the abundance-dependent missingness. The hypothetical
completed data comprises the missing and observed values. The known
physical properties of peptides and mass-spectrometers provide the
auxiliary information for the missing probability and missing
values. We use the selection model factorization and include
the left-censored missingness under a Bayesian framework. In two case 
studies, we estimate the likelihood of missingness using auxiliary variable
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and the intensity values.




## The computing algorithm 
Our proposed method utilizes Hamiltonian MC/Non-U-Turn Sampling 
for the posterior distribution. Compared to the Gibb sampling,
Hamiltonian MC (HMC) avoids the random walk by introducing the
leapfrog function. It provides an alternative to approximating the
solution on the continuous time scale from the solutions on the
discrete time scale, with a specified step-size. The logarithmic
posterior probability function was simulated by one of the paired
partial differentiated equations, namely the Hamiltonian. Larger
moving steps are generated from the leap frog scheme, and this helps
to improve the convergence compared to the random walk. It has been
shown to have higher efficiency in sampling high-dimensional
correlated multivariate distributions.  RStan is a new tool recently
developed to implement HMC modeling for Bayesian data analysis, of
which the posterior distribution can be sampled using the No-U-Turn
Sampling method -an extension of HMC. No-U-Turn sampling implements a
recursive algorithm that will enable auto-tuning of the couple
parameters in HMC: numbers of leap-frog steps and the discrete step.
We based on Rstan library function stan() to set up the program for our
proposed model. The R library "mlmm" is written to implement posterior
samplings using HMC.



# The mlmm R package 

The functions included in the pacakge "mlmm" are: 


1. setinitialvalue(): this function generates initiating values for
the parameters in the computing.

2. mlmc(): this function provides Rstan program to estimate the
posterior distribution of parameters in a linear regression model with
multivariate normal distributed respondents , for example the log
(peptide ion intensity) from mass-spec, and explanatory variables such
as a protein identification. Other explanatory variables can be
experimental variables and clinical design variables.  The protein
identification is an ID to link the peptides to its parent protein.
The probability of missing, missing and censored values of the
respondent variable are estimated in the algorithm through a logistic
regression and a truncated normal distribution for the censored
values. The probability of missing can be fitted via explanatory
variables such as the abundance and mass-to-charge ratio of the
observed ion intensity.  The censored values are modelled through
defining a truncated normal as its prior distribution.  mlmc()
function also provides option (respond_dep_missing=TRUE/FALSE) to
choose if the missing probability is depending on the magnitude of
missing value.

3. mlmm(): this function is similar to mlmc(), but it is written for
data without any censored respondent values in the regression
model. The input variables in this function are similar to those in
mlmm() but without terms for censored missing.

# Instructions and Examples of using main functions for regressions

The following section provides examples using a simulated dataset: pdata.
The examples include:

1. Examples with no informative prior and using "usefit=TRUE" to call the
Compiled model; and the default priors are used.

2. Example with informative priors and set "usefit=FALSE". 

When set up the formulas and parameters for using the mlmm() 
and mlmc() functions, some instructions are as follows: 

1.The formula_subject will need to have at least one variable.  For
example, to include subject-id for subject and this will provide the
mean value for each subject.

2.The missing and censor values in the response variable require
Different indicators, the missing and censor indictors are 
mutually exclusive. 

3.The number of iterations are better to set to be >1000. 
The default burn-in is half of the set iterations. 

## Read data and check data

```{r read data,eval=TRUE}
data(pdata,package="mlmm")
pdata[1:2,]
```

### Check for missing and censor indictors

Check if there is overlapped definition for missing and censor.  
The definition for missing and censored are differently defined. 
The following code is to check if the indicators for missing and 
censored are mutually exclusive. 

```{r table for miss and censor,eval=TRUE}
table(pdata$miss,pdata$censor)
```

If the indictors coded for missing and censored are overlapped, 
the following codes convert missing indictor from 1 to 0 
where censor =1.

```{r re-assign miss and censor,eval=TRUE}
n=dim(pdata)[1]
for (i in seq_len(n))
if (pdata$miss[i]==1 && pdata$censor[i]==1) pdata$miss[i]=0
```

After that, we can set the formula for response, probability of missing
and subject as the followings: 

### Set the formula for response, missingness and subject
```{r set formular examples,eval=TRUE}
formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment;
formula_missing=miss~var2;
formula_censor=censor~1;
formula_subject=~treatment;
response_censorlim=0.002;
```

Where var1 is the response variable, miss and censor are the indicator
variables for missing and censoring respectively. 

## Set the formula and fit the regression model 
The formula for subject requires at least one variable.  For
example, to include subject-id for subject and this will provide the
mean value for each subject.

### R examples for mlmc()
#### Example 1a. Set usefit=TRUE to call complied codes

When set usefit=TRUE, we can have posterior samples based on the
previous compiled codes.

```{r example 1a,eval=TRUE}
library(mlmm)
model2=mlmc(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment,
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_censor=censor~1, formula_subject=~sid, 
pdata=pdata, response_censorlim=0.002, respond_dep_missing=TRUE, 
pidname="geneid", sidname="sid", 
iterno=100, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=TRUE)
```

#### Example 1b-1c. Use a provided informative priors
Example 1b is to set priors for regression coefficients in the logistic
regression model for missingness.
alpha_prior is a prior for coefficients (including intercept) in the 
logistic regression to predict missing probability; it is a vector with
a length of (1+number of predictors).

Example 1c is to Use an informative prior for precision matrix in the
regression for completed data. 
prec_prior is the precision matrix prior of regression coefficients
-intercept and predictor (var2) in the completed data formula.

Example 1d is to use the usefit=TRUE option given informative priors.
This example is to have 1000 posterior samples based on the previous
model. 

```{r example 1b-1c,eval=FALSE}
model1=mlmc(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment, 
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_censor=censor~1, formula_subject=~sid, 
pdata=pdata, response_censorlim=0.002,
respond_dep_missing=TRUE, pidname="geneid", sidname="sid", 
alpha_prior=c(0,0.001), iterno=100, chains=2, 
savefile=TRUE, usefit=FALSE)

prec_example=matrix(c(0.01,0.001,0.001,0.01),nrow=2,ncol=2)

model3=mlmc(formula_completed=var1~var2, 
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_censor=censor~1, formula_subject=~sid+treatment, 
pdata=pdata, response_censorlim=0.002, respond_dep_missing=TRUE,
pidname="geneid", sidname="sid", prec_prior=prec_example,
iterno=100, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=FALSE)

model3b=mlmc(formula_completed=var1~var2, 
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_censor=censor~1, formula_subject=~sid+treatment, 
pdata=pdata, response_censorlim=0.002, respond_dep_missing=TRUE,
pidname="geneid", sidname="sid", prec_prior=prec_example,
iterno=1000, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=TRUE)

```


### R examples for mlmm()
Formulas for completed data, subject and missingness all require at
least one variable.

#### Example 2a. Set usefit=TRUE to call the complied code

```{r example 2a,eval=TRUE}
model5=mlmm(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment, 
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_subject=~sid, pdata=pdata,
respond_dep_missing=FALSE, pidname="geneid", sidname="sid",
iterno=100, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=TRUE)
```

#### Example 2b-2d. Provide informative priors
The user define priors include:

a) prec_prior : the precision matrix of the first-level parameters (var2 
and treatment);

b) alpha_prior: coefficients for intercept and var2 to predict 
probability of having missing value in logistic regression.

```{r example 2b prior,eval=TRUE}
prec_example=matrix(c(0.01,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.01,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.01),
nrow=3,ncol=3)
```

```{r example 2b, 2c and 2d,eval=FALSE}
model4=mlmm(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment, 
formula_missing=miss~var2,
formula_subject=~sid, pdata=pdata,
respond_dep_missing=FALSE, pidname="geneid", sidname="sid",
alpha_prior=c(0,0.001), prec_prior=prec_example,
iterno=100, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=FALSE)

#Example 2c. Use default priors 
model5=mlmm(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment, 
formula_missing=miss~var2,
formula_subject=~sid+treatment, pdata=pdata,
respond_dep_missing=FALSE, pidname="geneid",
sidname="sid", iterno=100, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=FALSE)

#Example 2d. set usefit=TRUE to call the compiled model from the previous run 
model5b=mlmm(formula_completed=var1~var2+treatment, 
formula_missing=miss~var2, 
formula_subject=~sid+treatment, pdata=pdata, 
respond_dep_missing=FALSE, pidname="geneid", 
sidname="sid", iterno=1000, chains=2, savefile=TRUE, usefit=TRUE)
```


## How to make plots of the parameters and to diagnose convergence

If the estimate converges, it will have high number of efficient samples 
and the rhat value will close to 1.  

The following codes are to:

1) plot posterior parameter using the outsummary results from multiple chains.

2) plot the trajectory of posterior sampling including those values generated 
from burn-in iterations.

### plot posterior parameters
```{r plot one,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
summaryreader=read.csv(file=file.path(getwd(),"outsummary.csv"),header=TRUE,
sep=",",skip=0)

iterno=dim(summaryreader)[1];burnin=iterno/2

U.1.1=rowMeans(matrix(c(summaryreader$chain.1.U.1.1,
summaryreader$chain.2.U.1.1),nrow=iterno,ncol=2))[burnin:iterno]

meanU=mean(U.1.1)
qU=quantile(U.1.1,p=seq(0,1,by=0.025))
scale=seq(0,1,by=0.025)

plot(scale,qU,pch=19,ylab="quantiles of estimate",xlab="quantiles")

segments(0,qU[names(qU)=="50%"],1,qU[names(qU)=="50%"],lwd=2,col="red")
segments(0,qU[names(qU)=="2.5%"],1,qU[names(qU)=="2.5%"],lty=2,lwd=2,col="red")
segments(0,qU[names(qU)=="97.5%"],1,qU[names(qU)=="97.5%"],lty=2,lwd=2,
col="red")

legend(0.5,qU[names(qU)=="50%"],"median",cex=0.8,bty="n")
legend(0.03,qU[names(qU)=="2.5%"],"2.5%",cex=0.8,bty="n")
legend(0.90,qU[names(qU)=="97.5%"],"97.5%",cex=0.8,bty="n")
qU
```

### plot trajectory of the posterior samples

```{r plot two,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
sample1reader=read.csv(file=file.path(getwd(),"samples_1.csv"),header=TRUE,
sep=",",skip=25)

sample2reader=read.csv(file=file.path(getwd(),"samples_2.csv"),header=TRUE,
sep=",",skip=25)

#plot variable U.1.1 - the intercept of first unit
trajectory_length=dim(sample1reader)[1]

plot(seq(1,trajectory_length,by=1),sample1reader$U.1.1,xlab="trajectory
number",ylab="U.1.1",type="n",
ylim=c(min(sample1reader$U.1.1,sample2reader$U.1.1,na.rm=TRUE),
max(sample1reader$U.1.1,sample2reader$U.1.1,na.rm=TRUE)))

trajectory=seq(1,trajectory_length,by=1)

lines(trajectory,sample1reader$U.1.1)
lines(trajectory,sample2reader$U.1.1,col="red")
```
